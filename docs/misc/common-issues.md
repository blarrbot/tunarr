# Common Issues

## Missing Hardware Acceleration Options

The hardware acceleration options listed in the FFMPEG Settings page are derived from output generated by the your configured `ffmpeg` executable. The command used to discover available hardware accel. options is

```
ffmpeg -hide_banner -hwaccels
```

There are a few reasons why your desired hardware acceleration option is not appearing in this list. Here a few of the common ones we've seen:

1. If using Docker, you are not using the appropriate image tag. For instance, if you want to use Nvidia hardware accel, you must be sure to use the `*-nvidia` labeled Tunarr builds. For iGPUs, like Intel GPUs, the `*-vaapi` Docker images are required.
2. The `ffmpeg` executable used by Tunarr is not correct. Double-check the executable path configured by Tunarr with the one in your CLI environment (`which ffmpeg`). One example of this running on Ubuntu and having installed a version of ffmpeg with `snap` (executable in `/snap/bin/ffmpeg`) and one with `apt` (in `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`).
3. The `ffmpeg` executable you are using does not have the necessary libraries compiled in. This can be verified with the hardware accel. command above.

If you've double-checked these things and still are experiencing issues, please open up a [new Q&A discussion topic](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=Missing%20Hardware%20Acceleration%20Option) so we can debug.
